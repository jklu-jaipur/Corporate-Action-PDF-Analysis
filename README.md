#### What are Corporate Actions? :thinking:
A corporate action is an event carried out by a company that materially impacts its stakeholders (e.g. shareholders or creditors).
Common corporate actions include the payment of dividends, stock splits, tender offers, and mergers and acquisitions.
Corporate actions must often be approved by a company's shareholders and board of directors.
